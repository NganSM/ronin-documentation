1. Network switch: this allows you to switch between the Ronin mainnet and Saigon testnet networks.
2. User icon: this opens the page for your connected address in Ronin Chain Explorer.
3. Eye icon: this allows you to hide your wallet balance.
4. Connected address: this allows you to copy the address or disconnect your Ronin Wallet from Katana and the Ronin app itself.

### Approve tokens

When a smart contract first interacts with a token in your wallet, it asks for your permission. You're prompted once for each token, and these prompts appear visibly before you can continue with your desired actions. 

For example, to stake an SLP/WRON token pair, you need to approve it first. Click **Approve SLP/WRON**, then confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.

Here's what you can adjust:

1. **Max slippage**: set a custom maximum percentage difference between the expected price and the price at the time of the transaction.
2. **Transaction deadline**: set a custom time limit for the transaction to be completed.
3. **Expert mode**: enable high price-impact swaps and remove the confirmation step.
