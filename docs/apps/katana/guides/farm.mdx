## Overview

When you provide liquidity to a pool on Katana, you receive liquidity pool (LP) tokens in return. You can stake these LP tokens in a _farm_ to earn rewards in the form or another ERC20 token, which is chosen by the farm creator. A farm can offer more than one reward token to choose from. In general, the more LP tokens you stake, the more reward tokens you earn. Farming is available for a limited number of pools at any given time. You can see the list of pools that offer farm rewards by turning on the **Farms only** filter on the **Liquidity pool** page.

## Prerequisites

To farm tokens on Katana, you need to have LP tokens that you can stake. To acquire LP tokens, add your liquidity to a pool as described in the [Pool](pool.mdx#add-a-liquidity-pair) guide.

## Start farming

1. Open [Katana](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) and connect your Ronin Wallet.
2. Select the **Liquidity pool** page, then turn on the **Farms only** filter to show the pools that offer farm rewards. All farming pools are displayed with a yellow lightning symbol and RON icon to the right side of the pool's name.

3. Select the pool you want to farm tokens in, then click the **Farm rewards** tab, and then select **Stake**. This opens the **Stake** panel for staking your LP tokens. In the **My position** panel, you can see how many tokens you have staked and how many are available in your wallet.

## Stop farming

To stop farming, you need to unstake the LP tokens from a farm pool. Unstaking means that you stop receiving reward tokens proportionate to how much LP tokens you unstake.

1. Select the pool you want to unstake from, then click the **Farm rewards** tab, and then select **Unstake**. This opens the **Unstake** panel for unstaking your LP tokens.

2. Enter the amount of LP tokens you want to unstake. You can also click **Max** to unstake all your LP tokens. When you're ready, click **Unstake** and confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.
