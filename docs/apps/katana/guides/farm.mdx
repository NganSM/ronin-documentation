## Overview

You can stake liquidity pool (LP) tokens on Katana to farm RON. Farming is the process of providing liquidity to a pool and earning rewards in return. The rewards are distributed in the form of RON tokens.

## Prerequisites

To farm RON on Katana, you need to have LP tokens in a pool that distributes farm rewards. To add LP tokens to a pool, see [Add a liquidity pair](pool.mdx#add-a-liquidity-pair).

## Start farming

1. Open [Katana](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) and connect your Ronin Wallet.
2. Select the **Liquidity pool** page, then turn on the **Farms only** filter to show the pools that support farming:

    -farm-only-

3. Select the pool. This opens the **Liquidity pool** tab, where the **My position** panel shows the amount of LP tokens you have in this pool.

    -add-liquidity-

4. Click **Stake** or select the **Farm rewards** tab.

5. If you have not interacted with the LP token before, you will need to approve the token. Click **Approve**, then confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.

    -approve-tokens-

6. Enter the amount of LP tokens you want to stake. You can also click **MAX** to stake the maximum amount of LP tokens you have in this pool.

    -my-positions-

2. Select the **Farm rewards** tab, then click **Unstake**.

4. Click **Unstake** and confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.

When the transaction is completed, you'll see a confirmation pop-up. You can click **View on Explorer** to see the detailed information on the transaction on Ronin Chain Explorer.
