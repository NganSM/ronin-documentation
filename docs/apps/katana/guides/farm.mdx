## Overview

You can stake LP tokens to farm RON. RON is the ecosystem token for the Ronin blockchain. Its main purpose is to secure the network.

## Prerequisites

To start farming RON, you need to have LP tokens in a pool that distributes farm rewards. To add LP tokens to a pool, see [Add a liquidity pair](pool.mdx#add-a-liquidity-pair).

## Start farming

1. Open [Katana](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) and connect your Ronin Wallet.
2. Select the **Liquidity pool** page, then turn on the **Farms only** filter to show the pools that support farming:

    -farm-only-

3. Select the pool. This opens the **Liquidity pool** tab, where the **My position** panel shows the amount of LP tokens you have in this pool.

    -add-liquidity-

4. Click **Stake** or select the **Farm rewards** tab.

5. If you have not interacted with the LP token before, you will need to approve the token. Click **Approve**, then confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.

    -approve-tokens-

6. Enter the amount of LP tokens you want to stake. You can also click **MAX** to stake the maximum amount of LP tokens you have in this pool.

7. Click **Stake** and confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.

Congratulations, you are now farming RON on Katana.

## Claim farm rewards

To claim your farm rewards, go to the **Liquidity pool** page, then select **My positions**, then click **Claim** next to the pool you want to claim rewards from.

Or you can select an individual pool and click **Claim all**.

-claim-all-

After you click **Claim** or **Claim all**, confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.

## Stop farming

To stop farming, you need to unstake the LP tokens from a farm pool. Unstaking means that you will stop receiving RON proportionate to how much LP tokens you unstake.

To unstake LP tokens, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **My positions** tab, then select the pool you want to unstake from:

    -my-positions-

2. Select the **Farm rewards** tab, then click **Unstake**.

    -unstake-

3. Enter the amount of LP tokens you want to unstake. You can also click **MAX** to unstake all your LP tokens. 

    -enter-amount-

4. Click **Unstake** and confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.

When the transaction is completed, you'll see a confirmation pop-up. You can click **View on Explorer** to see the detailed information on the transaction on Ronin Chain Explorer.

-success-

After unstaking, you can see an update in your total LP tokens staked and available in wallet reflective of the changes you made.
