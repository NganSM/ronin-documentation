title: Create a liquidity pool

## Overview

You can create your own liquidity pools (LP) on Katana, contribute your liquidity to existing pools, and earn trading fees from the resulting transactions.

When creating a new pool, you choose two tokens to pair together. These tokens can be any ERC20 tokens, including ["main" and "seed" tokens](../overview.mdx#trade-main-and-seed-tokens). The system deposits your tokens into a smart contract, effectively increasing the pool's liquidity.

For example, if you decide to contribute to the WETH-AXS pool, you need to
deposit an equivalent value of both tokens. Say the value of 1 WETH is USD 3,200.00 and the value of 1 AXS is USD 7.70. If you want to provide 1 WETH into the WETH-AXS pool, you also need to provide around 415 AXS.

In recognition of your
contribution, you receive _liquidity pool (LP) tokens_, which represent your share in the pool.

These tokens not only signify your stake but also entitle you to a portion
of the trading fees generated by the pool's transactions, directly
proportional to your contribution. These fees are added to pool and accrue in real-time. You can claim them by withdrawing your liquidity.

You can also stake your LP tokens to earn farm rewards. For more information, see [Farm](farm.mdx).

Be aware that earning a profit through providing liquidity isn't guaranteed.
You may face what's known as _impermanent loss_, a risk that arises from
fluctuations in the value of the deposited tokens.

## Prerequisites

To provide liquidity on Katana, you need to have tokens in your Ronin Wallet. You can acquire tokens by depositing from Ethereum using [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge), buying tokens through the [Purchase](https://purchase.roninchain.com) website, or receiving tokens from other users.
For more information, see [Acquire RON](../../../basics/acquire-ron.mdx).

## Create your own pool

1. Go to [Katana](https://app.roninchain.com/liquidity) and connect your Ronin Wallet.
2. Select the **Liquidity pool** page, then click **Create new pool**.

    * The share of the pool you will receive, which is 100% for a pool creator.

    Click **Create pool & Supply**, then confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.

6. Review the details of your liquidity contribution:
    * The amount of LP tokens you will get in return.

Congratulations, you are now a liquidity provider on Katana. You can now earn fees from the pool's transactions. If the pool supports farming, you can also stake your LP tokens to earn farm rewards. For more information, see [Farm](#farm).

## View your positions

To see all the pools you contributed to and the fees earned, open the **Liquidity pool** page, then select **My positions**.

![My positions](../assets/katana-pool-my-positions.png)

Here you can see the following information:

* The pools to which you contributed.
* The annual percentage rate (APR) for each pool.
* Your position in each pool.
* The fees you earned from each pool.
* Your claimable rewards from farming, if the pool supports it.

To view more details, such as the amount of LP tokens and the pool's performance over time, select each pool.

## Remove liquidity from a pool

Removing pool tokens converts your position back into underlying tokens at the current rate, proportional to your share of the pool. Accrued fees are included in the amounts you receive.

1. Open the **Liquidity pool** page, then select the pool from which you want to withdraw liquidity. 

    ![Liquidity pool](../assets/katana-pool.png)
