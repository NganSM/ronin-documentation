## Overview

You can contribute funds to liquidity pools (LP) on Katana, enabling you to earn trading fees from the resulting
transactions.

By engaging as a liquidity provider, you deposit pairs
of tokens into a smart contract, effectively increasing the pool's liquidity.
For instance, if you decide to support the ETH-RON pool, you need to
contribute an equivalent value of both tokens. In recognition of your
contribution, you receive LP tokens, which represent your share in the pool.
These tokens not only signify your stake but also entitle you to a portion
of the trading fees generated by the pool's transactions, directly
proportional to your contribution.

:::info Profits and risks
Be aware that earning a profit through providing liquidity is not guaranteed.
You may face what is known as _impermanent loss_, a risk that arises from
fluctuations in the value of the deposited tokens.

## Prerequisites

To provide liquidity on Katana, you need to have tokens in your Ronin Wallet. You can acquire tokens by depositing from Ethereum using [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge), buying tokens through the [Purchase](https://purchase.roninchain.com) website, or receiving tokens from other users.
For more information, see [Acquire RON](../../../basics/acquire-ron.mdx).

## Add a liquidity pair

1. Open [Katana](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) and connect your Ronin Wallet.
2. Select the **Liquidity pool** page. This page displays a list of available pools.

3. Search for the pool you want to contribute to. For example, if you want to provide liquidity for the ETH-RON pool, search for "RON".
    
    -search-
4. Select the pool. This opens the **Add liquidity** panel. This panel is similar to the **Swap** panel, except you see a plus sign (+) between the two tokens instead of an arrows sign (â‡…). This symbolizes that you will be adding both tokens into a pool.
    
    -add-liquidity-
  
    Here you can see the detailed information about the pool:
    * **Fee earned**: the percentage of the trading fee you will earn.
    * **Total value locked**: the total value of the pool, including the volume, fees, and transactions for the last 24 hours. 
    * Charts showing the pool's performance over time: volume, total value locked, and fees.
5. Enter the amount of tokens you want to contribute. Katana automatically calculates the equivalent amount of the other token based on the current exchange rate. You can also click **MAX** to deposit the maximum amount of tokens you have in your wallet. If everything checks out, click **Add**.
