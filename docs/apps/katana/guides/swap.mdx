## Overview

Swapping is the action of trading one of your tokens for another token via a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). DEXs are apps that allow people to exchange between any two assets by using smart contracts, without the need of a traditional bank or other trusted third party.

Katana DEX is an Automated Market Maker (AMM). This means it's always ready to buy and sell any tokens immediately.

:::info Desktop and mobile users
Katana Swap is no longer available to the users of the Ronin Wallet mobile app. Instead, mobile users can use the Wallet Swap feature.

* Desktop users: use [Katana Swap](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) on the web.

## Swap tokens

### Desktop users

1. Open [Katana](https://app.roninchain.com/swap). You can see the **Swap** tab selected by default.
2. Choose the tokens you want to swap from and to.
    
    You can click either of the token selection boxes to reveal the full list of supported tokens.
    
    After choosing the swap pair, you can see the tokens listed on the **Swap** panel. The top token is the token you have in your wallet. The bottom token is the one you want to swap your token with.
3. Enter the amount to swap: when you type in on one of the fields, the other populates based on the current exchange rate between the tokens.
4. Optionally, switch the from and to tokens by clicking the arrows sign (â‡…) between the tokens.
5. When you are ready to swap, click the **Swap** button.
    
6. In the **Confirm Swap** pop-up, review the details of your swap:
    1. The tokens to swap: ensure that the amounts are correct.
    2. Detailed swap information:
        * **Rate**: The exchange rate between the tokens.
        * **Price impact**: estimation of the slippage to expect based on your order size and market movements. This gives you an idea of how much you can receive.
        * **Max. slippage**: the highest percent of price movement of the transaction. Anything greater than this value results in a failed transaction.
        * **Minimum receive**: the lowest amount of tokens you can receive based on slippage tolerance. This is the worst-case scenario. Anything less than this value results in a failed transaction.
        * **Liquidity provider fee**: the fees allocated to LP provider (0.3% of the transaction value).
        * **Route**: the trading route taken for your order. It can be a direct "token A to token B" route, or there might be a bridge token in the middle, such as "token A through token B to token C." Direct route might not always be the cheapest.
7. Click **Confirm Swap** to start the swap.
    
   Confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.

A **Swap submitted** pop-up indicates that your transaction is submitted to the blockchain. You can close this pop-up or click **View on explorer** to view the transaction details in the Ronin Chain Explorer.

After a few seconds, your transaction is confirmed. You can see a banner appear on the browser window's top-right.

Congratulations. You just swapped your tokens on the Katana DEX.
