## Overview

You can swap tokens on Katana to trade one token for another. Swapping is a decentralized process that doesn't require a traditional bank or other trusted third party. This is made possible by using smart contracts to facilitate the exchange. As an automated market maker (AMM), Katana is always ready to buy and sell any tokens immediately.

### Swap on Katana and Ronin Wallet

The interface for the swap feature differs between Katana web and Ronin Wallet:

* Katana web: Use the swap feature on Katana in the Ronin web app.
* Ronin Wallet: Use the swap feature on within the Ronin Wallet mobile app or browser extension.

### Swap fees

When swapping tokens, you incur the following fees:

|Fee|Katana web|Ronin Wallet|
|---|---|---|
|Development fee|-|0.5%|
|Ronin treasury fee|0.05%|0.05%|
|Liquidity provider fee|0.25%|0.25%|

## Prerequisites

To swap tokens on Katana, you need to have those tokens in your Ronin Wallet. You can acquire tokens by depositing from Ethereum using [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge), buying through the [Purchase](https://purchase.roninchain.com) website, or receiving from other users.
For more information, see [Acquire RON](../../../basics/acquire-ron.mdx).

## Swap tokens on Katana web

1. Open [Katana](https://app.roninchain.com/swap) and connect your Ronin Wallet. Katana opens on the **Swap** page by default, with the **Swap** panel in the middle.

3. After choosing the swap pair, you can see the tokens listed on the **Swap** panel. The top token is the token you have in your wallet. The bottom token is the one you want to swap your token with. 
    1. Enter the amount to swap: when you type in on one of the fields, the other populates based on the current exchange rate between the tokens.
    2. Optionally, if you want to customize the transaction settings, click the cog icon in the top right. To view the details of your swap, click expand the exchange rate.
    3. When you are ready to swap, click the **Swap** button.

4. In the **Confirm Swap** pop-up, review the details of your swap:
    * **Rate**: The exchange rate between the tokens.
    * **Price impact**: estimation of the slippage to expect based on your order size and market movements. This gives you an idea of how much you can receive.
    * **Max. slippage**: the highest percent of price movement of the transaction. Anything greater than this value results in a failed transaction.
    * **Minimum receive**: the lowest amount of tokens you can receive based on slippage tolerance. This is the worst-case scenario. Anything less than this value results in a failed transaction.
    * **Liquidity provider fee**: the fees allocated to liquidity providers.
    * **Route**: the trading route taken for your order. It can be a direct "token A to token B" route, or there might be a bridge token in the middle, such as "token A through token B to token C." The direct route might not always be the cheapest.
    
    After reviewing the details, click **Confirm Swap**, then confirm the transaction in your Ronin Wallet.

Your transaction is now submitted to the blockchain. When it is completed, Katana displays a confirmation pop-up. Close it or click **View on explorer** to see the detailed information about the transaction.
